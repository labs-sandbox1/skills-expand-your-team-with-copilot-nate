# Mergington High School Activities

A super simple website application that allows students to view and sign up for extracurricular activities.

## Features

- View all available extracurricular activities
- Sign up for activities
- **Filter activities** by category, day, time, and difficulty level
- **Group activities by category** - organize activities into sections (Sports, Arts, Academic, etc.) while applying other filters
- Search for activities by name or description
- Share activities on social media (Facebook, X, LinkedIn) or via email
- Dark mode support

## Using the Group By Feature

The application offers two viewing modes to help you find activities:

### Filter by Category (Default)
In this mode, the category filter works as an exclusive filter - selecting a category (e.g., "Sports") will show only activities in that category.

### Group by Category
In this mode, all activities matching your other filters (day, time, difficulty, search) are shown, but organized into category groups. This is especially useful when you want to:
- See all activities on a specific day (e.g., Monday) organized by type
- Browse all available activities grouped by category
- Filter by time or difficulty while still seeing activities across all categories

**Example:** Select "Group by Category" and then filter by "Monday" to see all Monday activities organized into Sports, Arts, Academic, and Technology sections.
